## Hello
- On the next slide, you will see a plot of the 'mtcars' data set. I plot the mpg vs. the number of cylinders.

## Plot of Mtcars
```{r plotly, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(datasets)

library(plotly)
set.seed(100)

m <- mtcars

plot_ly(data = m, x = ~cyl, y = ~mpg, mode = "markers", type = "scatter", color = ~disp)
```

## Thanks for Watching!
- I look forward to your feedback.
